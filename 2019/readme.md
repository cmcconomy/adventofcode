This time I will be using a python notebook again, but with a slightly less annoying solution input.
I will simply request https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/{num}/input and populate the following cookie params: _ga, _gid, session.
These can be observed in the chrome page inspector / cookie storage section, once you've logged in.
